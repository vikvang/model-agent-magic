# Gregify Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for monetizing the Gregify Chrome extension, including pricing tiers, premium features, and implementation plans.

## Target Audience

Gregify targets several user segments:

3. **Teams and Organizations**: Groups that want to standardize prompt quality across members
4. **Developers & Technical Users**: Those who want to integrate prompt enhancement into workflows

## Monetization Model

- Basic prompt enhancement using the direct API method
- Limited number of enhancements per day (5)

For individual power users:

- Unlimited prompt enhancements
- Full multi-agent system for higher quality enhancements
- All available role templates (8+ specialized roles)
- Custom role creation (up to 3)
- Prompt history storage (last 100 prompts)

## Pricing Strategy Rationale

1. **Free Tier**: Provides enough value to demonstrate the product's capabilities while encouraging conversion to paid tiers. The 5/day limit is sufficient for casual users but restrictive for power users.

2. **Pro Tier**: Priced competitively with other productivity Chrome extensions ($7.99/month). The annual discount (approximately 2 months free) encourages longer commitments.

3. **Team Tier**: Positioned as a professional tool with significant value-add for organizations wanting to standardize their AI interactions.
